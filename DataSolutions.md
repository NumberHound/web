**Introduction:**

So you have found your data... But where do you store it? How can you clean it? Do you need to integrate it with another dataset? How can you analyze it? What software is best for you? For help with all of this, please see below.

For more in depth discussion on softwares for economists, please see [StackExchange](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/5853/most-common-programs-used-by-economists).

Also, for any help with any of these softwares, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) is your best friend. Seriously!

Always remember, if you run into a problem, chances are someone has run into that problem before. So there is probably any answer on Youtube or Google.

If something you find below is a link to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), note that Udemy constantly marks down their courses from $200 to $15-20. Never pay $200 for a Udemy course, wait for them to be marked down -- this happens almost weekly and on holidays. Also when you sign up for Udemy you usually get your first purchase (no matter how many courses) discounted.

Regardless of what you choose... I would recommend getting a [Github](https://github.com) account. Github is a leading software development platform. It is a great place to store data and scripts for your projects. It is also free unless you have very large file storage requirements. This is the best way to store all your project files in the cloud. You can also host a static website for free on Github. This is a great option if you want to create a personal page, a CV page, or a blog.

## General Thoughts

* Google Drive -- Best for free storage and simplicity.
* R or Python? Comes down to personal taste, sometimes depends on if you are doing something highly specialized.
* Best for Visualization? Tableau if you don't want to code, Python if you want to code.
* Best for Cleaning Data and Data Integration if I don't want to code? Excel and Excel Power Query.
* Best for Econometrics? STATA.

I need some inspiration/help with data visualization, where can I get it?

[from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) -- provides a complete breakdown of what visualizations are right for your data as well as information such as how to read those visualizations, common mistakes of those visualizations, and what packages you can use in R and Python to make those visualizations.

[The Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/) -- unique visualizations created by data scientists. 

What is most used in the real world? Python, by far, and it is still growing. Followed by Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. See:

## Data Storage

Memory sticks are always good, but if you're like me you forget them or you lose them. Take advantage of these great data storage solutions below.

[Amazon Web Services S3 (Simple Storage Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) -- AWS S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. The first 5 GB of storage on S3 are free, after that you pay a small amount for each additional GB. Buckets are highly encrypted in case you are storing sensitive data. Get started [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/?nc=sn&loc=5).

[Box](https://www.box.com/home) -- With Box, you can store any type of file in the cloud, from photos and videos to financial information, and access it easily anytime, anywhere. You can also work with all your cloud files from your desktop with Box Drive without using much hard drive space. Box offers 10 GB of free storage up front, but with payment you can get access to features like data loss protection, version history, and file sharing.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2) -- Very similar to Box in its capabilities and offerings. You can get 2 GB of storage for free, as well as useful features like sharing.

[Google Drive](https://www.google.ca/drive/) -- This is probably the best storage solution for students because you get 15 GB free. It also makes file sharing easy with others. If you have a google account, you already have a google drive.

[Microsoft One Drive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-ca/) -- Very similar to google drive in its offerings. Get 5 GB for free. If you buy a plan you can get office 365 included.

## Excel

Excel can be a powerful tool for data collection, data cleaning, data integration, and even visualization and analysis. Its capabilities are endless. You can also program your own functions in excel with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Some useful links for excel are below.

[Excel Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel/ct-p/Excel_Cat) -- Great place to find answers to your questions.

## Gretl

Gretl is a cross-platform software package for econometric analysis, written in the C programming language. It is free, open-source software. It is very simple to pick up, and runs a wide variety of econometric models. It will run better if you are working with smaller datasets. Gretl data files usually only work in Gretl, but you can easily copy them to excel or text formats.

## MATLAB

You can get MATLAB for free if you are a student (depending on what school you go to). MATLAB is very powerful and has applications across industries. MATLAB is best for simulations (e.g. Monte Carlo) and dynamic programming.

## Python

Python Python is powerful, fast, free, and open source. Python can be run in several ways. You will likely want to run it in a developer environment. I would recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). With Anaconda, you can execute Python Code in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and run small blocks of code by default. This way is sometimes better for beginners. Python is very versatile and can do almost anything you can think of, but it can be overwhelming at the beginning. I would recommend starting with a crash course or bootcamp.

## Power BI

Power BI is a business intelligence software, but it is very useful for visualization, creating dashboards for presentations, and even data integration. It is much cheaper than its counterpart -- Tableau. You can actually use Power BI for free, for as long as you want, without a license. When you open it, just ignore the prompts at the beginning which ask you to sign in or create an account.

## R

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. R is like python in that it is open source and has a ton of packages which can be added in. I recommend to, instead of downloading R, download R studio. R Studio is an integrated development environment which is more intuitive and functional than just R. R Studio comes with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If you want to learn a bit of Python and R, I would recommend just downloading Anaconda.

ABSOLUTE BEST, AND FREE WAY TO GET STARTED IN R: [Marin Stats Lectures](https://www.statslectures.com)
* This guy teaches R to beginners in R Studio. He will take you from the basics to cleaning data to visualizations to stats in R to linear regressions. He does it all in videos complemented by sample data sets he provides. He also gives you all script files.

## STATA

STATA is a powerful statistical software which was built with researchers in mind. The big dataset STATA can handle enormous datasets with ease. STATA now even has python integration on the new versions. The downside is... it is expensive.. but students can get special pricing, and check if you get it for free through your school.

## Tableau

Tableau is also a business intelligence software. It is a lot more expensive than Power BI, but it definitely has its perks over Power BI. I personally prefer it to Power BI. If you are a student you can get a one year license for free. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. Tableau is the best tool for data visualization and is the tool of choice on NumberHound. Student offer is available [here](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students).
