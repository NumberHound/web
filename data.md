## Data

Data for all posts on NumberHound can be found in the [NumberHound Data Repository](https://github.com/NumberHound/Data) in the posts folder. Data on other topics can also be found in this repository.

NumberHound also has more extensive collections of data on sports, including American Football, Hockey, and Soccer (Coming Soon). These collections include the following:

* Team Level data
* Individual Level data
* Analytics and Advanced metrics for players and teams
* Venue and attendance information
* Season Histories
* Awards and awards voting results
* Salary and contract information as well as team payrolls
* Team transactions such as trades and signings
* Entry draft histories

These collections are free, but not publicly available. If you are working on a project and wish to use this data or have further questions about this data, email woof@numberhound.com. Samples of the data, as well as codebooks, will soon be publicly available. After emailing about gaining access to one of these data collections, you will be granted temporary access to the data collections so you can download what you need for your project.

All NumberHound data is made available for educational purposes and should be used for projects.
