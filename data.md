## Data

Data for all posts on NumberHound can be found in the [NumberHound Data Repository](https://github.com/NumberHound/Data) in the posts folder. Data on other topics can also be found in this repository. This data is for educational purposes only and any other use of this data must be in compliance with the repository license. Any code used in R, Python, or other languages for the work posted on NumberHound can also be found in the same data repository.

NumberHound also has larger collections of data on sports including American Football, Hockey, and Soccer (Coming Soon). These collections include the following:

* Team Level data
* Individual Level data
* Analytics and Advanced metrics for players and teams
* Venue and attendance information
* Season Histories
* Awards and awards voting results
* Salary and contract information as well as team payrolls
* Team transactions such as trades and signings
* Entry draft histories

These collections are free, but not publicly available. If you are working on a project and wish to use this data or have further questions about this data, email woof@numberhound.com . Samples of the data as well as codebooks will soon be available in folders on the [NumberHound Data Repository](https://github.com/NumberHound/Data). After emailing about gaining access to one of these data collections, you will be granted temporary access to the data collections so you can download what you need for your project.
