title: The Hidden Side of Moneyball
---

  The movie Moneyball came out in 2011 and was based on Michael Lewis' book. The film made 110.2 million USD at the box office and scored a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. Moneyball focused on the [2002 Oakland A's](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2002.shtml), and how, despite losing three key players ([Johnny Damon](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/damonjo01.shtml), [Jason Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambja01.shtml), and [Jason Isringhausen](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/isrinja01.shtml)) the A's, with the help of some analytics, were able to make it back to the American League Playoffs. They were forced to be different because of their miniscule payroll. 

  In the film, the A's brought in [David Justice](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/justida01.shtml), [Scott Hatteberg](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hattesc01.shtml), [Jeremy Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambje01.shtml), and [Chad Braford](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bradfch01.shtml) to replace Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen (Note that Jeremy Giambi was later traded for [John Mabry](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mabryjo01.shtml)). And as the movie would have you believe, they played a huge part in Oakland's success the following season... But did they **really**?
