title: The Hidden Side of Moneyball
---

  The movie Moneyball came out in 2011 and was based on Michael Lewis' book. The film made 110.2 million USD at the box office and scored a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. Moneyball focused on the [2002 Oakland A's](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2002.shtml), and how, despite losing three key players ([Johnny Damon](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/damonjo01.shtml), [Jason Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambja01.shtml), and [Jason Isringhausen](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/isrinja01.shtml)) the A's, with the help of some analytics, were able to make it back to the American League Playoffs. They were forced to be different because of their miniscule payroll. 

  In the film, the A's brought in [David Justice](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/justida01.shtml), [Scott Hatteberg](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hattesc01.shtml), [Jeremy Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambje01.shtml), and [Chad Braford](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bradfch01.shtml) to replace Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen (Note that Jeremy Giambi was later traded for [John Mabry](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mabryjo01.shtml)). And as the movie would have you believe, they played a huge part in Oakland's success the following season... But did they **really**? 

  As pointed out in [The Sabermetric Revolution](https://www.amazon.ca/Sabermetric-Revolution-Assessing-Analytics-Baseball/dp/0812245725), Moneyball spent a lot of time selling the stories and the impact of the players brought in on the cheap. The movie actually leaves the viewer with the impression that the center pieces of the team were Hatteberg, Giambi, Justice, and Bradford. The first three were role players at best, combining for 5.6 [wins above replacement](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/war_explained.shtml) (WAR) during the 2002 season. However, they are the players seen most in the film, and based on the coverage they get in moneyball, one might think they are the most important and were the key to the A's success that season.

  In reality, the A's already had a great team in place -- [Eric Chavez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chaveer01.shtml) the five time gold glover, [Miguel Tejada](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tejadmi01.shtml) the six time all-star and actuall the American League MVP in 2002, and the two time all-star [Jermaine Dye](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dyeje01.shtml). Something which is also completely ignored is how good the A's pitching was in 2002. Led by an excellent pitching staff which included 2002 Amnerican League Cy Young Winner [Barry Zito](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zitoba01.shtml). However, these great players were largely ignored. So how much screen time (measured here as seconds being talked about in the movie plus seconds on the screen) did each player get relative to their value?
