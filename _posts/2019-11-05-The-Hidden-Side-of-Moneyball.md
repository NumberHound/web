title: The Hidden Side of Moneyball
---

The movie [Moneyball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) came out in 2011 and was based on Michael Lewis' book. The film made 110.2 million USD at the box office and scored a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. Moneyball focused on the [2002 Oakland A's](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2002.shtml) and how, despite losing three key players ([Johnny Damon](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/damonjo01.shtml), [Jason Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambja01.shtml), and [Jason Isringhausen](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/isrinja01.shtml)), the A's, with the help of some analytics, were able to make it back to the American League Playoffs despite their relatively minuscule payroll. 

In the film, the A's brought in [David Justice](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/justida01.shtml), [Scott Hatteberg](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hattesc01.shtml), [Jeremy Giambi](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/giambje01.shtml), and [Chad Bradford](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bradfch01.shtml) to replace Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen (Note that Jeremy Giambi was later traded for [John Mabry](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mabryjo01.shtml)). And as the movie would have you believe, they played a considerable part in Oakland's success the following season... But did they **really**? 

As pointed out in [The Sabermetric Revolution](https://www.amazon.ca/Sabermetric-Revolution-Assessing-Analytics-Baseball/dp/0812245725), Moneyball leaves the viewer with the impression that the centrepieces of the team were Hatteberg, Giambi, Justice, and Bradford. While these guys were no scrubs, they combined for only a 7.2 [wins above replacement](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/war_explained.shtml) (WAR) during the 2002 season. 

In reality, the A's already had a great team in place -- [Eric Chavez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chaveer01.shtml) the five-time gold glover, [Miguel Tejada](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tejadmi01.shtml) the six-time all-star and the American League MVP in 2002, and the two-time all-star [Jermaine Dye](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dyeje01.shtml). Something which is also wholly ignored is how good the A's pitching was in 2002 -- led by an excellent pitching staff which included 2002 American League Cy Young winner [Barry Zito](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zitoba01.shtml). However, these great players were largely ignored. So how much screen time (measured here as seconds being talked about in the movie plus seconds on the screen) did each player get relative to their value?

Under this comparison in the graph above, if each player was shown in the movie for an amount of time equal to how valuable they were to the team, the line would be a 45 degree line from the origin. However, we can see from the graph above that Oakland's top six players (According to WAR), including the AL MVP and the AL Cy Young winner, were largely ignored in the film. Further, Oakland had quite the starting rotation in 2002, something which was never mentioned in the movie. More bizarrely, the players who received the most attention on the screen were, at least on the field, of lesser importance to the team over the course of the season. It is worth noting as well that this metric of screen time is also quite generous to Chavez and Tejada -- their names were rarely mentioned in the movie, and when they did appear on the screen, a regular viewer wouldn't know who they were -- they look like regular teammates.

Which players deserved more screen time for what they brought to the team? Taking the difference between their percentage of screen time and percentage or WAR suggests that film should have focused more on the team's starting rotation as well as Tejada and Chavez.  Moneyball oversold the players brought in by the team on the cheap (with the help of sabermetrics), which in turn overshadowed the contributions of Oakland's key players. This disparity leaves the audience with the impression that the players brought in on the cheap were significant contributors, and that Oakland's new approach was the sole driver of success.
