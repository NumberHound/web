## The Paper Companion

What is the process behind writing a paper? Many people go a long way without really knowing (myself included).

*Note: this is written from an economics perspective but applies across the social sciences*


### So, what is your job as an economist (or any social social scientist)?

Tell a story. Tell it simply. ALWAYS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACTS AND INTERPRETATION.

### Types of Economics Papers

1. **Ex-ante: Assess the potential effects of a policy recommendation.** In this case, start by describing the context and motivation behind the policy. Then describe what the policy is, use an appropriate economic model to assess the impact. Back your analysis with relevant past cases and other examples. When looking at past examples and evidence, look for what is the same, and more importantly, _what is different_ to understand what could happen when the policy is implemented.

2. **Ex-post: Assess the impact of a policy.** In this case, start by describing the context and motivation behind the policy. Use an economic model to assess and understand the effects of the policy. Add to your analysis with data and statistical methods. The key difference between this type and an Ex-ante analysis is that you now have data! You have observed some outcomes and can assess them!

3. **Identify a problem and propose policy recommendations.** First identify a problem -- asymmetric information in the market, market friction, market failure etc. Understand the problem with economic models and discuss the outcomes -- are they all 'bad'? Use economic models to understand the problem and the channels through which it creates bad outcomes. Based on your analysis, and similar cases, propose careful policy recommendations.

4. **Academic Economics Paper. (Empirical or Theoretical)** A question and an answer discussed over x number of pages.

What should go in your introduction? (This should then be what you proceed to do in the paper)

* What is your research question?

* Why is your research question important? (Why should your reader care?) -- This is your motivation

* What did you do in the paper? Be short here -- "Using data from ________ I do several regressions... etc. "

* What did you find? (What was your main result? Make sure this ties back to your question.)

* What are the limitations of the paper and what is its place in the literature?

What should I put in my literature review?

A literature review should provide your reader with two things:

1. How does past literature usually think about this issue -- what economic models are used to think about this issue. If you have no guidance on how your story is modeled then you may have to develop your own model to think about the topic.

2. What empirical evidence is out there today on this area of research? What methods are used? What do the authors find?

Each paper in a literature must have a reason for being there! Do not put 20 papers which all do the exact same thing. Each paper which is included must add to the context of your topic. This will help the reader better understand where the literature is, if they are unfamiliar with the topic.
