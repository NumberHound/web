Please note that the resources for sports data are in alphabetical order. Not all resources on this page are free, especially in the Finance section. It is a good idea to check with your universities library, as you may already have access to some paid data resources. The economics webpage of your school's library should have some information about what economics data your school has special access to.

## A General Data Search

Here are some great data sites which cover many topics. You never know what you might find.

[Amazon Web Services](https://registry.opendata.aws) -- Amazon Web Services has a lot of open data which can be analyzed on your computer or in the cloud using services like AWS EC2. To check out the datasets you will need to create an AWS account (which is free). There is also [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search?page=1&category=d5a43d97-558f-4be7-8543-cce265fe6d9d) which has a variety of data products from reputable companies (Not all these data products are free).

[DataHub](https://datahub.io) -- Great place to find data on a various topics.

[Data World Open Data](https://data.world/datasets/open-data) -- Data world also has a large collection of data which cover topics from economics to censuses to environment to energy. The main website is [here](https://www.data-planet.com/).

[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) -- FiveThirtyEight is a website which writes pieces on politics, sports, economics, culture, and health/science. Along with the site does political and sports forecasts. A nice feature of the site is they post all their data and forecast data. The data is both [here](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com) and on [Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) in the data [repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).

[Github](https://github.com/collections/open-data) -- Github is a software building community which also has some data sets shared by users.

[Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com) -- If you know what you want, and have some key words for your search, I would suggest using this tool provided by google to find your data.

[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) -- When something is hard to measure, like popularity of something, a potential alternative to measuring popularity is using Google Trends. The problem with this is instead of giving you raw statistics, it gives you an index of everything.

**Governments:**

* Many cities make all their data public, here are some examples below
  * [Los Angeles](https://data.lacity.org)
  * [New York City](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us)
  * [Edmonton](https://data.edmonton.ca)

* Besides cities, states and provinces usually also make data public, for example
  * [British Columbia](https://data.gov.bc.ca)
  * [Texas](https://data.texas.gov)

* Countries usually also post data for download, for example
  * [Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data)
  * [United States](https://www.data.gov)

A quick google search can be done to see if your municipality, state/province or country has open data

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) -- Kaggle is a great resource for everything data science. You will just need to create a free account to download dataset.

[NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/) -- nearly 100,000 datasets mostly related to weather, climate and the environment.

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org) -- ProPublica is a journalism website, but they also publish all their data on their [Data Store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/).

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/) -- Reddit has a sub reddit which is specifically for datasets.

[Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com) -- Socrata has an open data store which cover a wide range of topics.

[Tableau Public Sample Data](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) -- has some great sample data sets to work with, as well as Web data connectors. These web connectors allow you to do things like analyze your own social media data.



When something is hard to measure, like popularity of something, a potential alternative to measuring popularity is using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/). The problem with this is instead of giving you raw statistics, it gives you an index of everything.
